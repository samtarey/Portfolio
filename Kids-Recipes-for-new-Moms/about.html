					I was born in India and married to marathi guy. I am happily married and have a two year old lovely daughter. Immediately after marriage we came to Seattle, USA. As my parents couldn't come and stay with us during and after my pregnancy due to some health issues around that time, I got to experiemnt with ingredients so that my daughter could find the food yummy. </p>
				<p>
					This blog is part of my web development project and I am really proud of this one. This idea is probably the result of my new experince as a mother. Motherhood has been the most amazing, tiresome, fullfilling, exciting experince. To have created something out of your own is a spiritual feeling. Experimenting with ingredients and trying to make more nutritious food for your child is part of routine for most moms out there. Thus a lot of recipes are born out of necessity and I thought of sharing those with new moms out there. Some recipes might be known to many but I am still sharing them here. I would appreciate any suggestions from your side as it would encourage me more to come up with new and healthy yet yummy recipes. I would look forward to them as they would be part of my days.
